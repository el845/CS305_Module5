# Project details: Snake

This is a python recreation of the classic game Snake.
Packages Used: turtle, keyboard, sys, time, & random

The player can use w, a, s, & d keys to move the snake around.
When the snake eats an apple, the snake grows.
If the snake fills the whole board, the player wins.
If the snake hits itself or the edge of the board, the player loses.
